# Independent Project Phase 1 - Cocktail Overflow

Cocktail Overflow is a cocktail web application that allows users to explore the types of cocktails that can be made 
using different kinds of alcohol. The user can select or search for an alcohol type or ingedient, explore a list of 
cocktails that can be made using that alcohol or ingredient. The user can select a cocktail from the list to see the recipe, glass
and ingredients for that cocktail. The user can like a cocktail, leave a comment and rating for the cocktail. The like, 
comment and rating have no persistence on cocktail change.
