# Cocktail Overflow

Cocktail Overflow is a cocktail web application that allows users to explore the types of cocktails that can be made
using different kinds of ingredients. The user can select or search for ingedient, explore a list of
cocktails that can be made using that ingredient. The user can select a cocktail from the list to see the recipe, glass
and ingredients for that cocktail. The user can like a cocktail, leave a comment and rating for the cocktail. The like,
comment and rating have no persistence on cocktail change.

Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

## Description

I built this project to make it easier to find new cocktail recipes to try as I wanted more variety on the types of cocktails
I could make. The application makes it easier to find new recipes based on an ingredient that you want to usef or a cocktail.

I learnt:
- How to use an API and implement searching through a database using various attributes
- How to implement a changing colour gradient in CSS
- CSS layout
